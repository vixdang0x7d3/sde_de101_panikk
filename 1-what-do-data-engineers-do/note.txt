Q: Where would you start if you're hired to enable data analytics ? How would you go about gathering requirements ?

A:

- First, i'll try my best to understand how the bussiness work. After i understand the process, i'll make questions about the requirements of the customers based on my understanding of the system; in addition to that, i'll also make questions about details that i'm not sure about

- Next i'll go and explore the datasources that are available if any and try to grasp the characteristiccs and shape of the data meanwhile i'll be reflecting on the requirements.

- After exploring the data, i'll make a high level plan of what i need to do:
		- Where can i get the data and how ?
		- How will i store and organize the data ?
		- What transformations i'll need to apply to the data to satisfy the requirements ?
		- Further downstream tasks: visualization, writing API, ML deployment, ... 
		- Decide the appropriate tools, frameworks and strategy for the job
